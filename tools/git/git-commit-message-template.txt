# Your commit message must start with a title. The title's first
# letter must be capitalized, and it must not end with a period.
#
# To match Git's builtin style, your title MUST be written in the
# imperative case. Basically, it should be able to complete the 
# sentence, "If applied, this commit will...", for example:
#
#   Fix a typo in somefile.txt
#   Add feature X when Y is enabled
#   Drop ...
#   Fix ...
#   Release ...
#   Document ...
#   Reformat ... (when it's just about style)
#   Restructure test directories
#
# The title must be fewer than 50 characters, which means it'll
# end before.........................this line.->|
# -----------------------------------------------|
Add your title here, following the rules above

# Keep at least one blank line between the title and the start of 
# the next section.

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to about 72
characters or so. In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
subject of the commit and the rest of the text as the body. The
blank line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless
you omit the body entirely); various tools like `log`, `shortlog`
and `rebase` can get confused if you run the two together.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

- Bullet points are okay, too

- Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded
  by a single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions
  vary here

Explain the problem that this commit is solving. Focus on why you
are making this change as opposed to how (the code explains that).

change? Here's the place to explain them.
